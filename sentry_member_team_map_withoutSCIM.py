"""
Note: using Okta? Read this:

- Sentry customers using Okta can uses this non-SCIM version of the script (provided the teams in their self-hosted
  instance are not provisioned/defined using SCIM).

- Okta should be set up in Sentry before running this script, because the script assumes
    members will be accessible in cloud Sentry. Setting up Okta allows them to be accessible.

- Note: Okta users will have to log in to Sentry for the first time to be correctly associated to teams. For instance,
  after running the script, we can observe the member/team mappings being set up when we check the audit log.
  However, it's only once the member logs in for the first time that the member actually shows up in the list of a team's members.
